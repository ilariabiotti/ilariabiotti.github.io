      <h3>Tempo - On Slowing Down. Video Excerpt</h3>

      <p>Digital HD video, color, sound. 6'13". Tierpark Berlin (DE). 2019 - 2020
<br>
In Tempo - On Slowing Down, the manatee tank of the Tierpark in Berlin starts a conversation with a smartwatch which fell into it. They discuss about how to slow down time while fishes and manatees swim by. Documentary moving images explore an underwater world from the first person point of view of the smartwatch, the surface as well as the depths of the manatee tank, through the gaze of its camera. Digital voices quote ´The Chronic Argonauts´ by English writer H.G. Wells and exchange personal memories. Are we witnessing the last allucinations of a drawning Smartwatch?</p>
